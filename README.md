# üé£ Fishing

This fishing script allows players to engage in fishing activities with different fish types based on water depth. The deeper the water, the rarer and more valuable the fish that can be caught. In addition to catching fish, there is a chance to find a treasure chest while fishing, which can contain rare items or bonuses. The script is designed to offer variety and excitement, with different fishing locations and conditions affecting the type and quantity of catches. It encourages exploration and rewards players with valuable items.
